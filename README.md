# Contact Book
This app can be used to store contacts. It has functionalities 
like CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE. Firebase authentication 
is enabled in this app. Users can use either use email id and password
or Mobile OTP verification method for signing-in. 
For fetching results I have used recyclerView.
